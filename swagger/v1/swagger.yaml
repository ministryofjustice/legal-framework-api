      description: |-
        POST a JSON payload containing request-id (a UUID generated by the client) and an array
                           of proceeding types (identified by ccms_code) to
                           return a response containing the same request-id and an array of merits taks, grouped
                           by application and proceeding type. <br/><br/>
                           The tasks listed under application must be done once for the entire application, the tasks listed under
                           each proceeding type must be done once for each proceeding type.  Each task is specified as a key-value
                           pair where the key is the task name, and the value is the tasks on which it is dependent, or an empty array
                           if it is not dependent on any other tasks. <br/><br/>
                           In the given example, proceeding type SE014 has three tasks, namely:
                           <ul><li><code>chances_of_success</code></li>
                           <li><code>children_proceeding</code></li>
                           <li><code>attempts_to_settle</code></li></ul>.
                           The <code>children_proceeding</code> task is dependent upon the <code>children_application</code> task (which is in the
                           application group) being completed before this can be completed.
