      summary: Request civil merits questions for a set of proceedings
      description: |-
        POST a JSON payload containing request-id (a UUID generated by the client) and an array
                         of proceedings (identified by ccms_code, whether they used delegated_functions and their client involvement type), to
                         return a response containing the same request-id and an array of merits tasks, grouped
                         by application and proceeding type. <br/><br/>
                         The tasks listed under application must be done once for the entire application, the tasks listed under
                         each proceeding type must be done once for each proceeding type.  Each task is specified as a key-value
                         pair where the key is the task name, and the value is the tasks on which it is dependent, or an empty array
                         if it is not dependent on any other tasks. <br/><br/>
                         In the given example, proceeding type SE013 has three tasks, namely:
                         <ul><li><code>chances_of_success</code></li>
                         <li><code>children_proceeding</code></li>
                         <li><code>attempts_to_settle</code></li></ul>.
                         The <code>children_proceeding</code> task is dependent upon the <code>children_application</code> task (which is in the
                         application group) being completed before this can be completed.
